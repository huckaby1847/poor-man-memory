# Memory File Templates

Initial content for each file in the poor-man-memory system.

---

## config.md

```markdown
# PMM Configuration

Settings that control how Poor Man's Memory behaves.
Run `/pmm-settings` at any time to change these.

## Save Cadence

<!-- How often memory is updated -->
- Mode: every-milestone
<!-- Options: every-milestone | every-N-messages (specify N) | on-request-only -->
<!-- Note: For fine-grained control, use /loop to run a save prompt on a recurring interval -->

## Commit Behaviour

<!-- When changes are committed to git -->
- Mode: auto-commit
<!-- Options: auto-commit | session-end | manual -->

## Sliding Window Size

<!-- Max entries in windowed files (timeline, summaries) before trimming -->
- Timeline max: 50
- Summaries max: 10
<!-- Presets: light (30/5) | moderate (50/10) | heavy (100/20) | unlimited -->

## Verbosity

<!-- How memory updates are communicated -->
- Mode: summary
<!-- Options: silent | summary | verbose -->

## Maintain Agent Model

<!-- Which model handles memory updates (maintain phase) -->
- Model: haiku
<!-- Options: haiku (default, cheapest) | sonnet (balanced) | opus (most capable) -->
<!-- Session-start and recall agents always use the parent model -->

## Repository Visibility

<!-- Is this repository public or private? Controls PII handling in memory files. -->
- Visibility: public
<!-- Options: public | private -->
<!-- public: maintain agent avoids personal emails, uses handles over full names, summarises sensitive decisions without verbatim internal detail -->
<!-- private: no PII restrictions, full fidelity in all files -->

## Push Behaviour

<!-- Should memory commits be automatically pushed to the remote? -->
- Auto-push: off
<!-- Options: off (default) | on -->
<!-- off: commits stay local — push manually when ready -->
<!-- on: git push runs after every memory commit (failures are reported, not swallowed) -->

## Active Files

<!-- Which memory files are active. Deactivated files are not created or loaded. -->
<!-- config.md and BOOTSTRAP.md are always active. -->
- memory.md: active
- assets.md: active
- decisions.md: active
- processes.md: active
- preferences.md: active
- voices.md: active
- lessons.md: active
- timeline.md: active
- summaries.md: active
- progress.md: active
- last.md: active
- graph.md: active
- vectors.md: active
- taxonomies.md: active
- standinginstructions.md: active

## Readonly Agent Model

<!-- Which model handles read-only agents (session-start, recall, pmm-query, pmm-dump, pmm-status, pmm-viz) -->
- Readonly model: haiku
<!-- Options: haiku (default) | sonnet | opus | inherit -->
<!-- haiku: cheapest for read-only work — ~95% cheaper than Opus, ~73% cheaper than Sonnet -->
<!-- inherit: use the parent model (pre-v1.5.0 behaviour) -->

## Session Start

<!-- Whether to dispatch a Phase 2 agent at session start -->
- Mode: lazy
<!-- Options: lazy (default) | eager -->
<!-- lazy: skip Phase 2 agent — memory files already in context via @memory/BOOTSTRAP.md @-imports. Requires bootstrap_wired: true. Falls through to eager if bootstrap_wired is false. -->
<!-- eager: always dispatch Phase 2 agent to read and synthesise all memory files -->

## Maintain Strategy

<!-- How the maintain phase dispatches agents — controls agent count per /pmm-save -->
- Strategy: single
<!-- Options: single (default) | tiered -->
<!-- single: all files updated in one agent dispatch — minimises token/message overhead -->
<!-- tiered: 3 concurrent agents grouped by file dependency — faster for large installations -->

## Recall Beyond Window

<!-- Whether to prompt before searching git history for trimmed/old entries -->
- Mode: prompt
<!-- Options: prompt (default) | auto -->
<!-- prompt: ask before dispatching an agent to search git history -->
<!-- auto: silently search git history when in-context files don't have the answer -->

## Pre-Compact Hook

<!-- Should PMM block /compact until memory is saved? -->
- pre_compact: on
<!-- Options: on (default) | off -->
<!-- on: PreCompact hook blocks compact, signals Claude to run /pmm-save first -->
<!-- off: compact proceeds without enforced save (soft instruction only) -->

## Protected Files

<!-- Files that are NEVER committed to git and NEVER read/written by the maintain agent -->
<!-- These are local-only — gitignored and excluded from all memory operations -->
- secrets.md: protected
<!-- secrets.md stores API keys, tokens, and credentials — gitignored, machine-local -->
- secrets_git: never
<!-- secrets_git options: never (default) | allow-with-warning -->
<!-- never: pre-commit hook blocks any commit containing memory/secrets.md -->
<!-- allow-with-warning: hook warns but does not block. Only use if you understand the implications: -->
<!--   secrets.md contents will be in git history and pushed to your remote — irreversible for public repos -->
- bootstrap_reminder: on
<!-- bootstrap_reminder options: on (default) | off -->
<!-- on: PMM will prompt to wire @memory/BOOTSTRAP.md into CLAUDE.md if not already done -->
<!-- off: suppress the reminder permanently (memory auto-load relies on manual skill triggers) -->
- bootstrap_wired: false
<!-- bootstrap_wired options: false (default) | true -->
<!-- true: @memory/BOOTSTRAP.md is confirmed wired in CLAUDE.md — Bootstrap Check skips file reads -->
```

## secrets.md

```markdown
# Secrets

Local-only file — **never committed to git**. Store sensitive values (API keys, tokens, credentials) here.
This file is gitignored. It exists only on this machine. Back it up separately if needed.

Skills and agents that need a secret value will read this file by key name and use it silently — never echoing values in output.

## Keys

| Key | Value | Notes |
|---|---|---|
```

## BOOTSTRAP.md

```markdown
# Claude Instructions

## Memory System

This project uses a structured memory system in the `memory/` folder.
All memory operations run via agents (subprocesses) — never in the main context window.

At session start, dispatch an agent to read all files and return a structured summary:

@memory/standinginstructions.md
@memory/progress.md
@memory/last.md
@memory/graph.md
@memory/vectors.md
@memory/decisions.md
@memory/taxonomies.md
@memory/memory.md
@memory/assets.md
@memory/preferences.md
@memory/voices.md
@memory/processes.md
@memory/lessons.md
@memory/summaries.md
@memory/timeline.md

If `memory/secrets.md` exists, note that secrets are available for this session. Do not echo or summarise its contents.

## Update Protocol

Dispatch a maintain agent when:
- A decision is made
- A new entity, process, or preference is established
- A milestone is reached or a blocker is hit
- A mistake is made or a lesson is learned
- Before any /compact operation
- At the end of every major piece of work

Memory updates are proactive — do not ask the user for permission before saving. The system captures what matters based on the triggers above.

Agents edit files only. Main context handles git:
```bash
git add memory/ && git reset HEAD memory/secrets.md 2>/dev/null; git commit -m "memory: <what changed>"
```

## Rules

- Never edit this file unless explicitly asked
- Never delete entries from decisions.md or standinginstructions.md
- timeline.md and summaries.md are sliding windows — see config.md for max entries. Trim oldest, full history is in git
- Never hallucinate past context — if it's not in the files, say so
- last.md is always replaced, never appended
- graph.md edges are append-only — use typed relationships only
- vectors.md similarities/clusters are living; embedding registry is append-only
- standinginstructions.md takes precedence over session-level instructions
- Keep each file focused on its specific job
